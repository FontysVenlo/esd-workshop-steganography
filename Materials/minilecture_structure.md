 **15–40 min: Mini-lecture**
- Briefly explain:
    - What steganography is
    - The difference from cryptography
    - Real-world uses (digital watermarking, covert comms, DRM)
- Show 2–3 visual examples (image, text, audio stego)
- Ask:   Where else could we hide data?; Let the room brainstorm.

#### What’s the difference between hiding a message and encrypting it?  

- Let them brainstorm some ideas
-  Encryption = scramble the message
- Steganography = hide the message’s existence
  Let’s see how humans and computers have been doing that for centuries.  

#### A Bit of History

  How do you think people hid information before computers?  

Show:
- Ancient examples:
- Modern digital version: hiding data in pixels, sound, text etc.

Ask:
-   If you lived in 1940 and wanted to send a secret photo — what would you do?  
-   What do you think changed once we went digital?  

  Computers made hiding easier — and harder to detect.  

#### Why is this relevant?

Where do you think steganography is used today?  

Examples: spying, copyright, censorship, digital art, printer tracking (modern color laser printers add a pattern of tiny, nearly invisible yellow dots to every page, which encodes the printer's serial number and a timestamp for tracing), medical records (patient details can be embedded in an X-ray image file without affecting the visual quality)

  If we already have encryption, why bother hiding data?  
- Explain why its used nowadays
-  Encryption draws attention; steganography avoids it.
- Used in journalism, activism, and digital rights.
- Also in espionage, malware, and puzzles.

Who thinks it’s mainly for good guys? Who thinks it’s mainly for bad guys?
Then conclude: it’s neutral—it depends who uses it.

It’s not about good or bad; it’s a tool. It depends who uses it.  

#### Software & Security 

Where could hidden data appear in your everyday tools?

Show examples:
- Watermarking AI images or PDFs
- Hidden payloads in software binaries
- Tracking leaks with invisible marks
- Malware downloading commands hidden in images

#### Comparing Methods (3–4 min)
- Compare with alternatives
- Talk about one versus another, but also how they compliment each other
- Examples : Cryptography, obsfuscation, watermarking etc.

#### Attacks

Show some real life examples.

#### AI Is Poisoning Data and is getting poisoned back

Give an example.

#### Transition to demo
Recap:
- It’s ancient but evolving
- It’s everywhere — from memes to malware
- Now you’ll _see_ how it works
