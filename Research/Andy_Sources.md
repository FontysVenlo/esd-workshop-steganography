## History

- greek slave herodotus [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.35]
- for the next few periods mostly developments for hidden inks and null cyphers (eg. first letter of each word forms another message)
- medieval times see the first instance of microtext (letters that needed a magnifying glass to be read), later perfected during ww2 (microdots)
- french pigeons microfilm??? 1870 french-rpussia war
- ww2 stuff
- modern times :
    - 2014 malware LURK [https://www.secureworks.com/research/malware-analysis-of-the-lurk-downloader]
    - 2011 StuxNet dupe [https://static.crysys.hu/publications/files/bencsathPBF11duqu.pdf]
    - 2020 multiple attacks [https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-steganography]


## Misc ideas exercises/demo
- Exercise 6: Detect a Hidden Message (Steganalysis basics)

Give two similar images:

One clean.

One with hidden data.
Ask students to detect which one is modified using:

Hex editor

Online steganalysis tool

Histogram/bit pattern comparison

✅ Introduces forensics mindset.

- Exercise 7: Audio Steganography (if you want variety)

Hide text in a WAV or MP3.

Listen: Does it sound different?

Extract the message.

✅ Shows other media types beyond images.

- 8. Design Your Own Steganographic Method (Paper exercise)

In groups:

Invent a new method of hiding data in a format (text, emoji, whitespace, filename, network packets, etc.)

Explain how to encode and decode.

Present to class.

✅ Boosts creativity + understanding.

- 9. “Is this steganography?” Classification Game

Show various examples:

Shortened URL?

DNA storage?

Tracking pixel?

Metadata?
Ask students: Is this steganography, cryptography, or neither? Why?

✅ Sharpens conceptual understanding.
