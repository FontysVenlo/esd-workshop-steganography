## OpenStego provides two main functionalities:

- Data Hiding: It can hide any data within a cover file (e.g. images).
- Watermarking (beta): Watermarking files (e.g. images) with an invisible signature. It can be used to detect unauthorized file copying.

## [Stegano](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/Stegano), a pure Python Steganography module.

Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity. Consequently, functions provided by Stegano only hide messages, without encryption. Steganography is often used with cryptography.

# Outguess
Outguess is an advanced steganography tool. Outguess will conceal your document inside image (JPG) of your choice.

# SilentEye
_SilentEye_ is a cross-platform application design for an easy use of steganography, in this case hiding messages into pictures or sounds. It provides a pretty nice interface and an easy integration of new steganography algorithm and cryptography process by using a plug-ins system.

# StegCracker
Steganography brute-force utility to uncover hidden data inside files.

# Steghide
Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical tests.
