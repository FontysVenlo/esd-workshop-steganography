 Cryptography - instead of hiding the existence of a message (as in steganography), cryptography hides the meaning of a message.

examples: symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing

to be used when: you want to keep data secret, verify authenticity, or ensure integrity.  
however: the message is visible, even if unreadable.



Obfuscation -alters or disguises data/code so it’s hard to interpret but not impossible to find.

examples: code obfuscation, data obfuscation, protocol tunneling

to be used when: you want to slow down reverse engineering or conceal communication patterns.  
however: doesn’t offer cryptographic security.



Watermarking - embeds identifiable information into media (images, audio, video) for ownership or integrity tracking.

examples: digital watermarking, fragile watermarking  

to be used when: verifying authenticity or ownership.  
however: not for concealing messages.
